# cloud-computing-paas

In the second project, we will build a distributed application that utilizes PaaS services and IoT devices to perform real-time face recognition on real videos recorded by the devices. Specifically, we will develop this application using Amazon Lambda based PaaS and Raspberry Pi based IoT. Lambda is the first and the most widely used Function as a Service PaaS. Raspberry Pi is the most widely used IoT development platform. This project will provide you with experience in developing real-world, IoT data driven cloud applications.
